Abstract: This Article categorizes the world’s copyright laws according to the degree to which they provide exceptions to copyright exclusivity for research uses. We classify countries based on the degree to which they have a research exception in their law that is sufficiently open to permit reproduction and communications of whole works of any type by any user, such as in a text and data mining (TDM) project. We show that nearly every copyright law has at least one exception that promotes uses for research purposes. We find six different approaches, however, that range from permitting only quotations of some works by some users (the most closed) to what we refer to as “open” research exceptions, which can be applied to any research use, of any work, by any user. We also apply the typology to exceptions passed specifically to enable TDM research. This report may be useful in helping countries find models for domestic copyright reform as well as for consideration of guidelines or norms for harmonization between countries.
